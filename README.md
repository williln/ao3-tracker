Making my dream AO3 text-to-Notion pipeline 

## What is this? 

This is all [Simon's](https://twitter.com/simonw) fault, is what it is. 

I have a fear of coding in public! Coding for work? No problem. Constructive feedback on PRs? Bring it on. But personal projects? Eh, that seems pretty scary. 

But I also read a *lot* of fanfiction, and I have yet to cobble together a way to keep track of the things I am reading, the things I want to read, and the things I have read. [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/) is the platform I read most works on, but it doesn't have an app or an API, and its built-in tools for keeping track of all this stuff don't meet my needs. 

So I'm going to build something. Simon gave an [awesome talk at DjangoCon US 2022 about personal projects](https://github.com/simonw/djangocon-2022-productivity) that really inspired me to get over myself, work in public, and build the thing I want. 

## Can I help? 

This repo is technically open source, but y'all... I know myself. I'm going work on this as I have time. I suck at responding to PRs and issues for non-work projects. So please don't PR to this repo, because your PR will languish for too long and it will frustrate you how uncommunicative I am. Don't say I didn't warn you. 

Anyway, maybe this will be my last commit to this project! Who knows! I'm doing this for fun and you're welcome to follow along.
